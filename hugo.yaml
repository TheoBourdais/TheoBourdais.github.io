    content: |-
      I am a PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working under the supervision of Prof. Houman Owhadi. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, Gaussian processes, and computational mathematics.

      My work focuses on developing new theoretical frameworks and practical algorithms for understanding complex systems and data. I am particularly interested in:
      - Computational Hypergraph Discovery
      - Model Aggregation techniques
      - Gaussian Process methods
      - Random Matrix Theory applications in machine learning
