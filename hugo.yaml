      I am a PhD student at Caltech working under [Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm) and honored to be a [Kortschak Scholar](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars).

      My research focuses on Gaussian Processes and their applications in Machine Learning and computational mathematics, particularly:
      - Computational Hypergraph Discovery
      - Model Aggregation techniques
      - Random Matrix Theory applications
