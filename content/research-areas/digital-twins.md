# Digital Twins

My research in digital twins focuses on creating robust digital representations of physical systems by combining multiple models and data sources. The key challenge I address is **model uncertainty** - how to create reliable digital twins when we have multiple competing models and uncertain data.

## Research Overview

Traditional digital twins rely on single models, but real-world systems are complex and no single model captures all aspects perfectly. My approach develops frameworks for **aggregating diverse computational models** to create more accurate and reliable digital twins.

### The Model Uncertainty Problem
- **Multiple models** may describe the same system differently
- **Data uncertainty** affects model reliability
- **Computational trade-offs** between accuracy and speed
- **Real-time constraints** in operational environments

### My Solution: Model Aggregation Framework
- **Variance-minimizing aggregation** outperforms error-minimizing approaches
- **Uncertainty quantification** through ensemble methods
- **Robust combination** of physics-based and data-driven models
- **Adaptive weighting** based on model performance

## Key Research Contributions

### Model Aggregation Theory
My breakthrough finding: **Minimizing empirical variance often outperforms minimizing empirical error** when combining models.

**Why this matters:**
- Traditional approaches focus on minimizing training error
- But generalization depends on prediction stability
- Variance minimization leads to more robust ensemble predictions
- Particularly effective under model uncertainty

### Theoretical Framework
