# Algorithm Discovery

My research in algorithm discovery focuses on developing computational frameworks that can automatically uncover algorithms and functional relationships from data without requiring prior knowledge of the underlying governing equations. This work sits at the intersection of machine learning, computational mathematics, and scientific discovery.

## Research Overview

The fundamental challenge I address is: **How can we automatically discover both the structure and function of complex systems from observational data alone?**

Traditional approaches to understanding complex systems require:
- Prior knowledge of governing equations
- Assumptions about system structure
- Manual feature engineering
- Domain expertise

My approach enables **automatic discovery** of:
- Functional relationships between variables
- Graphical structure representing these relationships
- Sparse connectivity patterns
- Non-linear interactions

### Hypergraph Representation
- **Hyperedges** connect multiple variables simultaneously
- **Sparse structure** discovery through regularization
- **Interpretable representations** of complex relationships
- **Multi-scale analysis** capabilities
