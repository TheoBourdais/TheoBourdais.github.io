## About me

I am a PhD student at CalTech, in the [Computing and Mathematical Sciences Department](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/), under the supervision of  [Houman Owhadi](http://users.cms.caltech.edu/~owhadi/index.htm). I am also honored to be a [Kortschak Scholar](https://www.cms.caltech.edu/research/kortschak-scholars). Prior to joining Caltech, I received a Master's degree from Ecole Polytechnique, as well as a Master's from the University of Cambridge. 

I am interested in Gaussian Processes and their interaction with other domains of Machine Learning, like Deep Learning, as well as other application in computing sciences like solving partial differential equations.
